Review for the MadLibs project by Armine (GSL-12)

The overall design 
In overall, the program is well designed and it is easy to follow. The interactions of the various pieces of code make sense. Each part is well-structured and logically connected, allowing the program to function smoothly, however, there is a minor error in the code. 

Functionality 
The program prompts the user to select a template for a story, after which it gathers several inputs to generate and display the story. There is a minor error in the code, in particular, the variable name should be partofthebody instead of partofthebody2 in for the first story. Othwerwsie, the program functions as intended, seamlessly guiding the user through the process. The use of the random library is appropriate and aligns with the program's requirements.
It would be a valuable enhancement if the code included input validation, prompting the user to re-enter data when the input is incorrect. This would improve the program's robustness and user experience.

Complexity 
The program is already quite streamlined and easy to understand. The code could be made even more concise by using a for loop to prompt for input and store each response in a variable. This approach would reduce redundancy and make the code cleaner and easier to manage.

Naming 
The developer chose excellent names for all variables, making the code clear and easy to understand.?

Comments
While comments are included and may not be strictly necessary for a program of this simplicity, developing a habit of adding more detailed explanations would be beneficial for the user. This practice will enhance clarity, especially as programs become more complex.

Good Things 
Overall, the program is clearly and well-written, successfully meeting all the game's requirements. It's great to see that lists are effectively used for handling random variables, which adds to the program's efficiency and readability.
